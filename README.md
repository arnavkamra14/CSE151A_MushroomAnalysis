The exploratory data analysis conducted on the mushroom datasets provides insight into the distinguishing edibility characteristics. The primary dataset, with 173 observations across 23 features, including cap dimensions, colors, shape, surface, and more, reveals details about biodiversity. It does contain a number of null values which are concentrated in about five features. The secondary dataset expands the scope with thousands of observations for stem dimensions, ring type, and cap shape, alongside other features, and is devoid of null data. We performed introductory visual and statistical analysis, and saw a few patterns emerge, such as the distribution of cap diameters and color variations. These datasets' have the potential to reveal discriminative features critical for distinguishing digestibility. Through careful data preprocessing—including cleaning, normalizing, and feature extraction—we aim to move closer to accurately distinguishing between edible and poisonous mushrooms.
